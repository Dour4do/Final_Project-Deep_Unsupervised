This repository contains two main components:

VAE.py: A Python script implementing a Variational Autoencoder. This script is useful for learning and experimenting with generative models in a straightforward Python environment.
GANS.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the training and application of Generative Adversarial Networks. This notebook is designed to provide interactive education and experimentation with GANs.
